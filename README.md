## HowToPlay
The object of the game is to cross over to the water, without hitting any of the bugs. Each time you cross, you will receive 10 points, but the number of bugs will increase, then their speed will increase making it more difficult to cross each time.

You start the game with three lives, represented by the hearts in the upper left corner. If you hit a bug, you'll lose one life. After all three lives are lost, the game will end and you will see your final score.

To restart the game, the game must have ended, then you can press the spacebar to start again.

## HowToStart
To start the game you will need to open the index.html file. This is the easiest way if you just want to get straight to the game.

## Improvements
Some possible ways to improve the game might be:
1. Add bugs going in opposite direction.
2. Add gems that give points around the screen.
3. Add rocks that would prevent the player from moving into certain areas of the board.
4. Add an option for players to choose their own avatar.
